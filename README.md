# Switch to $BIP

Having fun in the group chat with a joke tweet about Leo bull posting $BIP leads to ChatGPT putting a proof of concept together.

## Switch to $BIP swaps $DOG for $BIP 

With the option for *All Posts* or *Only @LeonidasNFT*, there is nothing else to the plugin. Refresh after changing the setting. Report bugs in a PR I guess?

## Install

Click on the green **<span style="color: #00FF79;"><> CODE</span>** button to **Download ZIP** and unpack where you want to keep it — the extension will run out of this folder.

1. Head to Chrome and go to *chrome://extensions/* for the URL
2. Enable *Developer Mode* in the top right corner
3. Click *Load Unpacked* and select the folder **switch-to-bip** we downloaded.
